# Noun Phrase Structure Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edge Direction Issue
**Problem**: In "a scooter", the edge was going from "scooter" to "a" (wrong direction)  
**Fix**: Ensured determiners are children of the phrase, not parents

### 2. Hierarchical Structure  
**Problem**: "my fat friend" was decomposing flatly into three children: "my", "fat", "friend"  
**Fix**: Created proper hierarchical structure:
```
"my fat friend"
  ├── "my" (poss)
  └── "fat friend" (core)
      ├── "fat" (adj)
      └── "friend" (head)
```

### 3. Duplicate Children
**Problem**: Word nodes were being reused with existing children, causing duplicates  
**Fix**: Clear children from word nodes before adding them to phrases

## Implementation Details

The `build_noun_phrase` method now creates hierarchical layers:

1. **Layer 1**: Compounds and adjectives closest to the noun
   - Creates sub-phrase like "fat friend"
   
2. **Layer 2**: Possessives and numerals  
   - Wraps the inner phrase, e.g., "my [fat friend]"
   
3. **Layer 3**: Determiners (outermost)
   - Final wrapping, e.g., "a [scooter]"

This creates linguistically accurate phrase structures that decompose properly in the visualization.
