# Double-Enter Bug Fix Test Guide

## Issue Description
The double-enter bug occurred when navigating to a new word (via double-click, history buttons, or URL navigation) - the word input field would appear empty, requiring the user to enter the word again.

## Root Cause
The issue was that Streamlit's widget state (`st.session_state.word_input`) wasn't being properly updated when the `current_word` changed through navigation, even though the `value` parameter was set correctly.

## Fix Applied
Added explicit widget state management in `src/ui/sidebar.py`:

```python
# Force widget to update by clearing and setting if needed
if current_word and not selected_word:
    # For navigation case, ensure the widget shows the current word
    if 'word_input' not in st.session_state or st.session_state.word_input != current_word:
        st.session_state.word_input = current_word
```

## Test Steps

### 1. Test History Button Navigation
1. Enter "sheep" and press Enter
2. Enter "dog" and press Enter  
3. Click the "sheep" button in search history
4. **Expected**: Input field should immediately show "sheep" (no double-enter needed)

### 2. Test Double-Click Navigation (if working)
1. Enter "sheep" and press Enter
2. Double-click any node in the graph
3. **Expected**: Input field should immediately show the target word

### 3. Test URL Navigation
1. Enter "sheep" and press Enter
2. Manually change URL to add `?navigate_to=dog`
3. **Expected**: Input field should immediately show "dog"

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Input field shows the correct word immediately after navigation
- ‚úÖ No need to enter the word twice
- ‚úÖ Word is processed and graph updates on first navigation
- ‚úÖ Debug logs show proper input value calculation

## Debug Information
Look for these log entries to verify proper behavior:
```
üîç LOG: [INPUT_VALUE_CALCULATION] input_value='[word]' selected_word='None' current_word='[word]'
üîç LOG: [TEXT_INPUT_RESULT] word='[word]' input_value='[word]'
```

The `input_value` should match the `current_word` when navigating.
